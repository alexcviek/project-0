# project-0
ðŸŽ® A game made as part of WDI27 in London

## Technologies used:
* HTML 5
* CSS animations
* SCSS
* jQuery 3.10
* Gulp
* NPM
* Git & github

## Challenges faced:
* How to coordinate the choices board with the array of characters - it was too painful to change everything in JS and then in HTML file too. => Created the choice board in JS, so the characters are directly taken from there. No need check if values are corresponding!

## Improvements:
* Improve overall styling
* Add extra features, apart from basic options like Attack/WarCry/Defend
